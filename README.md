## Introduction

Axiom Node is a NodeJS package for accessing the [Axiom](https://www.axiom.co/)
API.

## Installation 

```
 git clone https://github.com/axiomhq/axiom-node
 cd axiom-node

```

## Authentication

The Client is initialized with the url of the deployment and an access token. The access token can be a personal token retrieved from the users profile page or an ingest token retrieved from the settings of the Axiom deployment.

The personal access token grants access to all resources available to the user on his behalf.

The ingest token just allows ingestion into the datasets the token is configured for.


## Usage

You need to at least provide the URL of your deployment and a valid personal 
access or ingest token.

```ts
import Client from '../lib/client';

const depylomentURL = process.env.AXIOM_URL || '';
const accessToken = process.env.AXIOM_TOKEN || '';

const client = new Client(depylomentURL, accessToken);

// ...
```
